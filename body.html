    <h1>The Art Of War by Sun Tzu - Page 12</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 7 - Maneuvering</h2>
    <p>
      In all kinds of warfare, the direct approach is used for attack, but the
      oblique is what achieves victory. A general who understands the use of the
      oblique has a source of tactics as inexhaustible as Heaven and Earth,
      which, like the Rivers and the Oceans, will never run dry. Like the Sun
      and Moon, they diminish and then replenish; they constantly renew
      themselves like the cycle of the Four Seasons. There are only five basic
      notes in music, [12] but their variations are infinite. There are only five
      primary colours, [13] but when blended, their shades and hues are limitless.
      There are only five principal tastes, [14] but their combinations produce
      more flavours than can ever be tasted. In military strategy, there is only
      the direct and the oblique, but between them they offer an inexhaustible
      range of tactics. The direct and the oblique lead naturally one into the
      other, like an ever-turning wheel, so who can ever exhaust their resource?
      The surge of rolling flood-water washes away boulders: this is called
      momentum. The swoop of a falcon strikes and kills its prey: this is called
      timing. Thus for a skilled warrior, his momentum must be irresistible and
      his timing precise. Momentum is the tension in a crossbow arm; timing is
      the pulling of the trigger.
